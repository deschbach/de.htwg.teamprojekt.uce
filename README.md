# [UCE - Universal Connection Establishment](http://ice.in.htwg-konstanz.de/)

Universal Connection Establishment (UCE) is a framework for firewall and NAT traversal
techniques that is designed to provide universal IP connectivity with minimal administrative
and configuration overhead.

## NAT introduction

Network Address (and Port) Translation (NAT / NAPT) allows address sharing of public IP
addresses and hiding private networks from the public. The downside is that NAT breaks
the end-to-end principle and prevents incoming pakets that are not related to outgoing
traffic from traversing the NAT device. As a result, hosts behind NAT are not reachable
from the public internet. For an explanation of NAT and it's terminology see
[RFC2663](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2663). This is especially problematic for P2P
applications that require direct connections between participating peers.

One can distinguish between NAT mapping, that is how a NAT maps public endpoints (IP, Port)
to private endpoints, and NAT filtering, that is how the NAT deals with incoming pakets
and connection requests. Four strategies are common 
(see [RFC5128](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5128) for more explanation):

* Endpoint-Independent (EI)
* Address-Dependent (AD)
* Adress- and Port-Dependent (APD)
* Connection-Dependent (CD)

The mapping and filtering behavior on a NAT device is usually called the _NAT behavior_.
There can be multiple NAT devices between two peers, the sum of all NAT behaviors on 
the path is called _NAT situation_. The NAT situation is decisive for the success of
NAT traversal strategies.

## NAT Traversal Components

NAT traversal describes the process of traversing NAT devices from the outside world
with the intend of enabling incoming pakets that are unrelated to outoing traffic.

The following NAT traversal techniques have been proposed 
in literature. See [P2PNat](http://www.brynosaurus.com/pub/net/p2pnat/),
[RFC5128](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5128).

*	Direct connect

	If the target peer is publicly available or has a persistent mapping on the 
	NAT or a user defined mapping the source can directly connect to the public
	address.

*	Relaying

	Instead of directly communicating with each other, the peers connect to
	a public relay server. This always works but puts pressure on the relays
	and might increase delay and latency which is undesirable in certain applications.

*	Connection Reversal

	If only the target (serving) peer is behind NAT, or the source (requesting)
	peer's NAT is configured for persistent port forwarding or otherwise
	has a persistent non-filtering mapping, the connection can be reversed.
	In this case the target peer connects to the source peer. This requires
	the target to maintain a connection to a rendezvous or mediator that 
	signals the connection request and tells the target to reverse the connection.

*	Hole Punching

	Both peers open connections to the outside, thus creating a mapping in the
	NAT, effectively punching a hole. This mapping can then be used to connect
	to. Requires some sort of rendezvous server to exchange public and private
	endpoints.

* 	UPnP

	If the NAT box supports UPnP it can be directed to automatically create
	persistent mappings. The peer behind this NAT box is then effectively
	visible from the outside.

There are other solutions like NAT-PMP or SOCKS which are not discussed here.
A good overview can be found on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAT_traversal).

## So what's UCE and what's different

UCE tries to unify a multitude of NAT traversal techniques in one library
(and application) that is able to guarantee connectivity in basically any
network environment. It tries to collect information about the NAT situation
and then uses some logic to find the best suitable NAT traversal method.

In that regard it is quite similar to ICE or ANTS. ICE, however, is only defined
for UDP-based media streams whereas UCE focuses entirely on TCP. ANTS promises
similar behavior for TCP. Unfortunately, there is no implementation publicly
available. You can test their [NAT-Analyzer](http://nattest.net.in.tum.de/) 
(you can also download the code there if you look closely)

An essential part of UCE is exposure to Java RMI. That allows building RMI
applications over NAT and firewall boundaries.

## Contents

All modules and bundles are located in a flat hierarchy parallel to
parent. Modules are components of UCE. Bundles are different from modules
in the way that they extend and bundle modules to new releases. E.g.
'UCE Messages' is a module that implements all the core messages, while
'UCE Core' is a bundle that bundles all UCE core functionality to
one release.


* 	README.md

	This readme file
	
* 	LICENSE

	The license file. GPLv3.

* 	parent/

	The parent project with all global definitions and dependencies.

* 	uce/

	The UCE build project. Defines and builds all modules and bundles.
	Here run 
		mvn compile
	or
		mvn package

* 	core/

	Core functionality that is used by multiple other modules.

* 	plugininterface/

	UCE is built to be extendible using plugins and the java Service Loader.
	The plugininterface includes all common interfaces for NAT behavior, situation
	traversal techniques, method handlers and so on. All NAT traversal techniques
	for instance must implement the interface NATTraversalTechnique.

* 	stun/

	Another core technology in UCE this is an implementation of the
	[RFC5389](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5389) STUN message standard. Only
	the messages are implemented here. Custom message handlers as well as custom 
	NAT traversal STUN messages are implemented alongside specific NAT traversal
	techniques.
	 
*	stun.server/

	An implementation of a STUN server. This is _not_ compliant to RFC 5389
	since it uses TCP exclusivly and also opens TCP connections to the STUN
	client in order to investigate NAT filtering behavior.

* 	connectivitymanager/

	The connectivity manager implements all the logic of collecting NAT information,
	identifying the NAT situation and then choosing a suitable NAT traversal
	techniques. For that it always has a control connection open to a publicly
	available mediator (see below). The connectivity manager requires the implementation
	of at least one NAT traversal techniques as plugin in it's classpath or
	plugin path. For easy use in your application, use the
	connectivitymanager, to manage you connections transparently.
	
*	connectivitymanager.demo/
	
	A demo chat application that uses the connectivity manager to establish a
	peer-to-peer connection behind NATs and provides a simple CLI chat between
	the peers. You need to manually copy the NAT traversal jar files into
	the plugin directory for testing.

*	mediator/

	The mediator is a publicly available rendezvous server that handles peers,
	peer requests, and exchanges endpoints. As the connectivity manager it requires the
	presense of NAT traversal plugins for the messages it should handle.

*	directconnection/

	Implementation of the direct connection NAT traversal (not really a traversal
	method though).

*	directconnection.mediator/

	Direct connect request handler for the mediator.

* 	directconnection.message/

	STUN messages for direct connection.

* 	holepunching/

	Implementation of parallel TCP holepunching NAT traversal.
	
*	holepunching.mediator/

	Holepunching request handler
		
*	holepunching.message/

	Holepunching STUN messages.

*	relaying/

	Implementation of a TURN like relaying NAT traversal.

*	relaying.mediator/

	Relaying request handler.
		
* 	relaying.message/

	Relaying STUN messages.
	
*	relaying.server/

	Implementation of a TURN like Relay server. Not compliant to the standard.
	
*	reversal/

	Implementation of connection reversal NAT traversal.

*	reversal.mediator/

	Connection reversal request handler.
	
*	reversal.message/

	Connection reversal STUN messages.
	
*	socketswitch/

	A proof-of-concept implementation of TCP socket switching. Is able to switch
	connections from one socket to another. This should enable to change sockets
	on-the-fly while maintaining an active connection from an application point
	of view. Not very well tested, code is a mess right now and it is not yet
	integrated into the UCE framework.

## State of UCE

UCE originates from a BMBF funded research project. Most components are in a
proof-of-concept or prototype state. See the [project page](http://ice.in.htwg-konstanz.de/)
for detailed information, references, publications and presentations.

Currently implemented are the NAT traversal techniques mentioned above as well
as the connectivity manager, a modular mediator, STUN and relay server. There
are no plans from our side to extend this for support of further techniques.

## Clone and build UCE

- Clone the repo
	
		git clone git@github.com:htwg/UCE.git

- Compile and package

		cd UCE/uce
		mvn package

## Test the connectivity manager demo

- Copy the the connectivitymanager.demo-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar
  to a target machine behind a NAT device and to a source machine 
  (either behind NAT or not).
  
 - On both machines create a directory called 'plugins' under the same
   directory you put the connectivitymanager.demo in.
   
 - Copy all desired NAT traversal jars along with their custom messages into
   the plugins directories.
  
- It should now look sth like this:

		./connectivitymanager.demo-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar
		./plugins/
			directconnection-1.0.jar
			directconnection.message-1.0.jar
			holepunching-1.0.jar
			holepunching.message-1.0.jar
			relaying-1.0.jar
			relaying.message-1.0.jar
			reversal-1.0.jar
			reversal.message-1.0.jar

- On the _target_ machine run:

		java -cp connectivitymanager.demo-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar de.fhkn.in.uce.connectivitymanager.demo.chat.ChatTarget <targetID>
		
  Where targetID is any arbitrary string you want as identifier for the target
 
- On the _source_ machine run:

		java -cp connectivitymanager.demo-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar de.fhkn.in.uce.connectivitymanager.demo.chat.ChatSource <targetID>
		
  Where targetID is the same identifier you used before.

You should now have a running CLI-based chat between the (NATed) peers.

*BEWARE* The demo application uses a built-in mediator and STUN server IP. These servers
are hosted by us and might not always be available.

To see how to integrate UCE into your own application see the connectivitymanager.demo
implementation. It boils down to do sth like the following:

		import de.fhkn.in.uce.connectivitymanager.connection.UCESocket;
		import de.fhkn.in.uce.connectivitymanager.connection.UCEUnsecureSocketFactory;
		
		UCESocket socketTpPartner = UCEUnsecureSocketFactory.getInstance().createTargetSocket(targetId);
        socketTpPartner.connect();

## Run your own mediator

- Build UCE as above.

- cd mediator

- Unpack the UCEAIOMediator-1.0-bin.[tar.gz, zip] archive. This is currently required, since we do not have a jar-with-dependencies yet

- in the UCEAIOMediator-1.0 directory, create a directory `plugins`

- copy all the NAT Traversal plugins you want your mediator to use to the plugin directory. You need both the <nattrav>.mediator and <nattrav>.message jars. 
	
- Your UCEAIOMediator-1.0 directory should look sth. like this:

		./core-1.0.jar
		./jcip-annotations-1.0.jar
		./log4j-1.2.17.jar
		./mediator-1.0.jar
		./plugininterface-1.0.jar
		./slf4j-api-1.6.1.jar
		./slf4j-log4j12-1.6.6.jar
		./stun-1.0.jar
		./plugins/
			directconnection.mediator-1.0.jar
			directconnection.message-1.0.jar
			holepunching.mediator-1.0.jar
			holepunching.message-1.0.jar
			relaying.mediator-1.0.jar
			relaying.message-1.0.jar
			reversal.mediator-1.0.jar
			reversal.message-1.0.jar
		
- copy the whole UCEAIOMediator-1.0 directory to your target mediator machine

- cd to UCEAIOMediator-1.0 and execute

		java -cp mediator-1.0.jar de.fhkn.in.uce.mediator.Mediator <port> <user clean interval> <max lifetime>
eg.

		java -cp mediator-1.0.jar de.fhkn.in.uce.mediator.Mediator 10140 300 600
	
The mediator is now working on your own machine. To use it from the connectivity manager, you hava to change the mediator.properties. Unfortunately it does not currently work to change the system properties from the command line. To change the mediator.properties goto the directory:

	connectivitymanager/src/main/resources/de/fhkn/in/uce/connectivitymanager/mediatorconnection/

Edit the file `mediator.properties` like this:

	mediator.ip=<your mediator ip>
	mediator.port=<your mediator port>
	mediator.keepalive=600
	
Afterwards you have to rebuild the connectivity manager and the demo.

Similarly, you can also change the plugin directory location of the connectivity manager and the mediator. Just look into the appropriate resources directories, find the registry / techniqueregistry dirs and change the file `nattraversalregistry.properties`.

## How it works

A target behind NAT that wants to be publicly available registers with a
publicly available mediator. In addition a public UCE STUN server can be used
to investigate the NAT behavior. A client that wants to connect needs to know
the mediator and the registered target ID. The cnnectivity manager on the source
side decides in which sequence NAT traversal techniques should be tried and using the 
mediator issues connection requests and starts connecting. As a last resort,
relaying is tried.

## What's left to do and how to contribute

Although UCE work has proven to work quite well in our tests there are some open
issues.

- The build process does not yet support ready to use bundles without
  manual interaction like copying stuff etc
  
- UPnP support would be nice, although most UPnP implementations have severe
  security issues and should not really be activated. It is important to note here
  that all NAT traversal techniques implement the equals method correctly.

- Although UCE is intended for TCP, it would be nice to have a UDP HP implementation
  and be able to use UDP tunnels for TCP.

- UCE is both targetted towards RMI and P2P. But both is not yet really well
  supported. Although RMI has in all development stages been present and well
  tested (it works), the refactored implementation lacks the required RMI
  Factory classes.
 
- P2P support would require a mechanism to decentralize the mediators. This in
  turn would require a better user management as now (none at all). Sth like
  uuid@MediatorIP:MediatorPort would uniquely identify a user on a specific
  mediator (like SIP or Diaspora does). Then of course mediator-to-mediator
  communication must be implemented, that is, forwarding requests and responses
  between mediators. Same would be nice for relay servers too. Stun servers, however,
  do not require such a behavior.

If you like to contribute and think that you could deal with one of the issues
above, or you have your own ideas / improvements, just fork the repo, do your
stuff and send us a pull request. Also feel
free to contact the project maintainer at any time.
